    "### Troubleshooting Tips\n",
    "- If you get import errors, make sure Twin4Build is properly installed\n",
    "- If components fail to connect, check that the input/output names match exactly\n",
    "- If simulation fails, verify that all required parameters are set\n",
    "- If plotting fails, ensure the component IDs match those in your model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Tips\n",
    "- Use appropriate step sizes for your simulation (smaller steps = more accurate but slower)\n",
    "- Only save simulation results for components you need to analyze\n",
    "- Use the plot_component function for efficient visualization\n",
    "- Consider using semantic models for complex building systems"
