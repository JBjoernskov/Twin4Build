class ShadingDeviceSystem(core.System):
    """A shading device system model for controlling solar heat gain.

    This model represents window blinds, shades, or other devices that control
    solar heat gain through windows. The model acts as a pass-through for shade
    position control signals, allowing other systems to control the shading device.

    The model simply passes through the shade position from input to output, allowing for
    control of the shading device by other systems.

    The shade position is typically represented as a value between 0 and 1, where:
    - 0 represents fully closed/blocked
    - 1 represents fully open/transparent
